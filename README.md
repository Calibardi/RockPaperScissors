# RockPaperScissors
Simple app written in Swift/SwiftUI showcasing some basic elements.

The app is built using a finite subset of SwiftUI's capabilities.
Specifically the ones showed in the first 25 days of (100 Days of SwiftUI)[https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui].
I will probably refactor some pieces of this app following next sessions of the course.
